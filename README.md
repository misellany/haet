# Hello!
This is my repository for projects I want to share. Mostly, I'm trying to hone my coding skills. I used to want to because I want to create stuff but couldn't for the life of me. But some of my Full Stack developer friends who encouraged me in learning and pursuing something in this field boosted my confidence in myself and decided to push for it, why not right? I've started Free Code Camp and maybe I can enhance my skills that way while learning on the job from different developers and engineers. 

This won't be updated all the time but I will try to update as much as I can.
